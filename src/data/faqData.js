        question: "What Method of Learning does MWS use?",
        answer: "In order to create students capable of facing 21st-century challenges, MWS educates children to develop a love of learning. Our instructional design uses the latest advancement in PBL (Project and Problem Based Learning) and block system.\n\nIn line with our philosophy, we believe children have different talents and dispositions as well as multiple intelligences: our pedagogical models are highly differentiated.\n\nThe main subjects are taught during an extended 'main lesson block' for the first two hours of each morning, for a period of between 3 to 6 weeks – allowing an in-depth exploration of one subject at a time, thus enabling students to explore it fully, through intellectual, artistic and practical activities and ensuring a deep consolidation of learning.\n\nThe main lesson ties one topic to as many disciplines as possible. Each Main Lesson is rhythmically structured so that the children have to listen, work independently, participate and think at different times – involving the child in activities that awaken his or her powers of head (intellect), heart (feeling) and hands (doing).",
